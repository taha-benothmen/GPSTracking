# Real-time GPS Tracker for Ambulance

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a real-time GPS tracker for an ambulance using Raspberry Pi, Python, and JavaScript. With this system, you can track the ambulance's live location from anywhere in the world, enabling hospitals to know its exact location in emergencies.

## Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ (or a compatible model)
- GPS module

## Software Components
1. Making a Real-time Geolocation Tracking Webpage
   - PubNub API: Used to deliver real-time GPS data from the Raspberry Pi to the webpage.
   - Google Maps API Key: Enables the integration of Google Maps for visualizing the ambulance's location.

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect the GPS module to the Raspberry Pi as per the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Ensure the Raspberry Pi has a stable internet connection.

## Software Setup
1. **Raspberry Pi Configuration:**
   - Install the necessary libraries and Python packages for GPS communication.
   - Write the Python script to collect GPS data and send it to the PubNub service.

2. **Real-time Geolocation Tracking Webpage:**
   - Create an HTML webpage for displaying the ambulance's live location.
   - Integrate the Google Maps API for visualizing the location.
   - Use PubNub's JavaScript SDK to receive real-time GPS data and update the map.

## Usage
1. Power on the Raspberry Pi and start the Python script for GPS data collection.
2. Access the real-time geolocation tracking webpage from any web browser.
3. The webpage will display the live location of the ambulance on a Google Map.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have a PubNub account and API keys for data transmission.
- Securely store your Google Maps API key.
- Keep the Raspberry Pi and GPS module powered and connected for continuous tracking.

## Limitations
- As this project requires real-time data transmission, it may not work well on a local development environment. To see the result, you need to deploy it on a public server with internet access.
- The security and privacy of sensitive data must be taken into consideration when deploying in a real-world scenario.
